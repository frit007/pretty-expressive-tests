## Haskell pretty printers 

This directory contains all Haskell implementations.

- Bernardy's naive implementation is at the `PrinterPaper` subdirectory.
- Bernardy's practical implementation is at the `TextPatched` subdirectory.
- Bernardy's original practical implementation is at the `Text` subdirectory (with exponential blowup issues).
- Wadler/Leijen's implementation is not included, as it is installed as an external package.
- `benchmarks` contains all benchmarks that are run by `racket scripts/gen-table-2.rkt` in the root directory.
